# Things to be tested further
I need help verfiging the pulldown for each board to revise the silk screen on the back. 
GOAC va4 likely needs adjusting to balence the sega cd input.  It might require a swap of resistors on the psg channel.  
Currently testing a value of 86.6k on FM and 137k on PSG
This only impacts cd audio balence at the moment
